GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2024 Red Indie Games and POWERHACK
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                    Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. This license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program, to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you are notified of your rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute, and/or modify the software.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1. Definitions.

This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductors.

"When we speak of free software, we mean software that grants you the following freedoms:

1. The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
2. The freedom to study and change the program so you can make it do what you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
3. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
4. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

2. Copyleft.

This is how copyright allows you to distribute copies of the Program (but not its modifications). You can make and distribute the Program and your modified versions under the terms of this License, but you must keep the license and copyright notices intact. This means you can’t distribute the Program or derivative works based on it without making it clear that it is licensed under the GPL.

1. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

2. You must keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and you must give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients’ exercise of the rights granted herein.

3. If you distribute copies of the Program, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, have the same freedoms that you have. If you distribute the Program, you must include the source code or an offer to provide the source code.

4. This License applies to all versions of the Program you distribute. If you want to distribute a version of the Program that is different from the original, you must provide the source code for that version as well.

5. This License does not permit you to impose any additional restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted herein. You may not use the Program in a way that conflicts with the License.

6. If you believe someone has violated the terms of the License, you must notify them and give them a chance to comply.

7. If you do not comply with the terms of this License, your rights under this License will automatically terminate, but you will still be able to recover your rights if you comply with the terms of this License.

8. This License shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the copyright holder resides.

9. There is no warranty for the Program, and the copyright holder is not liable for any damages that may occur as a result of using the software.

10. If you have any questions about this License, please refer to the Free Software Foundation website.

                            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

 To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

 If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) Red Indie Games and POWERHACK

for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".


 The GNU General Public License allows you to use this software commercially but does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License. But first, please read
