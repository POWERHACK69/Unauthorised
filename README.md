**Unauthorized** is a terminal-based game where players dive into a mysterious digital world, uncovering hidden files, cracking passwords, and piecing together an intriguing narrative. Set against a neon green terminal interface, the game challenges players to decipher encrypted data and unravel a conspiracy.

Created by Red Indie Games (and POWERHACK), *Unauthorized* is a love letter to retro computing, cryptography and encryption puzzles. 

## Why GPLv3 Licensing?

"Unauthorized" is a project by Red Indie Games (and POWERHACK) for the GitHub GameOff 2024 Jam. By licensing this game under the GPLv3, I aim to:

- **Protect my work while sharing it openly with the community.**
- **Encourage others to learn, contribute, and improve upon it.**

The GPLv3 license gives you the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the game (non-commercially/commercially) while ensuring that future versions remain open and free. This license protects the community and ensures that the project stays true to its open-source ethos.

## A Small Request 

If you use or build upon *Unauthorized*, I’d love to see what you create! Feel free to tag **Red Indie Games** (or **POWERHACK**) in your projects, social media posts, or devlogs. While it’s not mandatory, it really helps me grow as a small indie creator and inspires me to keep making open-source games and tools.

Your contributions, feedback, or simply sharing your experience helps me grow as a developer and further fuels my passion for creating unique indie games.
